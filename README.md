By this code we will learn:

1. Predicting the House Prices using Decision Tree Regressor
2. FITTING THE DECISION TREE MODEL
3. FINDING mean absolute error (MAE)
4. How to reduce the Error by checking the MAE at various Depth of the Decision tree
5. How to Compare Different Tree Sizes
6. How to know when our model is fit?


The train data and test data are provided by Kaggle. The prediction target is the Sale Price of a house given its features such as area, no of bedrooms, year built in and so on. The model is evaluated on the root mean square error between your predictions and the truth value.
